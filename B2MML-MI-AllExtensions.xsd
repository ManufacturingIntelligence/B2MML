<!-- 
                        Purpose of Extensions Schema

This Extensions schema is intended to be edited by users as required to extend B2MML 
to meet project and product requirements. 

A place holder has been added in the core schemas.  The place holder 
is a substitution group that points to a group in this schema.  Any elements placed in a group
in this schema can be used in B2MML XML documents using "Extended" as the namespace prefix.  

The elements added to the groups may reference types defined earlier in this schema or in
other schemas.  Additional schemas may be used to permit element definitions from different 
vendors to be used on one project with minimal changes to the B2MML extensions schema,  
and increasing clarity by assigning a vendor specific namespace prefix to each group 
of elements when used in an XML document.
